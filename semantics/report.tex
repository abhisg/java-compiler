\section*{Aim of the project}
The aim of the project was to develop a compiler for Java which supports object oriented features of java like inheritance,polymorphism and encapsulation,apart from the various statements,operators and data types present in Java.
\section*{Achievement}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data types:basic data types(byte,short,int,long,char,float,double),derived data types(array,object)
\item Tokens:Literals(integer,floating point and string),identifiers,keywords,comments(multi line and documentation comment supported)
\item Operators:all arithmetic,logical and relational operators that java supports,ternary operator(short circuit evaluation supported;operator overloading supported)
\item Statements:implicit type conversion for basic types,print statements,assignment(single and multiple),if statement,if else statement,while,for and do while loops,switch(nested statements supported wherever applicable)
\item Functions:arguments and return types consisting of basic and derived types(overloaded functions supported;recursive functions supported;call through super keyword supported)
\item OOP Features:interfaces(limited support),classes,objects,inheritance,polymorphism(Liskov substitution principle supported),access modifiers(private and public),static and non static member variables and functions,default and parameterised constructors(explicit constructor invocation supported)
\end{itemize}
\section*{What was not achieved}
\begin{itemize}
\item Garbage collection
\item Nested classes
\item String operations
\end{itemize}
\section*{Contribution of the group members}
\begin{itemize}
\item Abhijit Sharang--lexical analysis,syntax analysis,semantic analysis,code generation,debugging at all stages(50\%)
\item Akshay Kumar---lexical analysis,syntax analysis,debugging at other stages(20\%)
\item Kumar Rajput--syntax analysis,code generation(20\%)
\item Sateesh Kumar Meena--debugging,lexical analysis(10\%)
\end{itemize}
\section*{Others}
The complier was generated using \texttt{lex} and \texttt{bison}.The language used for the development was C++
